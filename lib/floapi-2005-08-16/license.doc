This document contains the rules by which you can use, alter or publish
parts of floAPI. floAPI has been created by Joshua Hatfield in his spare 
time. You are legally bound to follow the rules described in this document.

Rules:

   !! floAPI is NOT Public Domain, shareware, careware or the like !!

   You may under no circumstances make profit on *ANY* part of floAPI in
   any possible way. You may under no circumstances charge money for
   distributing any part of floAPI - this includes the usual $5 charge
   for "sending the disk" or "just for the disk" etc.  By breaking these rules 
   you violate this agreement, and hence will be sued.

   You may not remove any copyright notices from any of the documents or
   sources given to you.

   This license must *always* be included "as is" if you copy or give
   away any part of floAPI (which is to be done as described in this
   document).

   If you publish *any* part of floAPI, I, as creator, must appear in the
   article, and the article must be clearly copyrighted subject to this
   license. Before publishing you must first send me a message, by
   snail-mail or e-mail, and inform me what, where and when you are
   publishing (remember to include your address, name etc.)

   Any running version of floAPI must include my name in the login and/or 
   intitial connection sequence. Furthermore the if there is a credit section
   or command in any application using floAPI, it shall always contain my 
   name, addresses, and a notice which states I have created floAPI.

   You are allowed to alter floAPI, source and documentation as long as
   you do not violate any of the above stated rules.

Regards,

Joshua Hatfield


Note:

I hope you will enjoy floAPI, and encourage you to send me any reports on 
bugs (when you find 'it'). Remember that I am using my spare time to write and 
improve floAPI, bugs, etc. - and changes will take their time.  I have so 
far put a number of programming hours into this project.  If you make any major 
improvements on floAPI I would be happy to hear from you.  As you will 
naturally honor the above rules, you will receive new updates and improvements 
made to the class.
